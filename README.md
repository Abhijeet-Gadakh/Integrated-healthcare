## Analysis:
1. The classification models showed high accuracy in identifying Covid, brain tumor,
Alzheimer's, Pneumonia, Diabetes, and heart disease.
2. Random Forest algorithm performed well in predicting Diabetes and heart disease.
3. Convolutional Neural Networks performed well in predicting all other diseases.
4. The GUI developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, integrated with Flask, makes it easy for
users to interact with the disease prediction models.
5. The CNN models used for Covid, brain tumor, Alzheimer's, and Pneumonia, were trained on
image datasets, and have the potential to provide accurate diagnoses using medical imaging.
6. The accuracy of the classification models can be further improved by increasing the size and
diversity of the training datasets, optimizing hyperparameters, and using other advanced
machine learning algorithms
